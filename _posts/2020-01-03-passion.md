## I'm serious about what I want to accomplish, but I don't take myself seriously.

## I love to teach, almost as much as I love to learn

If you write code, you know it's an error prone process.
I share my mistakes, especially the dumb ones, with my team so they don't have to repeat them.
Being vulnerable forces me to put my ego aside and makes it easier to communicate with teammates and learn from them.

## Share, don't hoard

Not all work environments are as collaborative and productive as we'd like them to be. Changing this is possible, but it takes work; that's right, __changing culture takes work__.

What is culture?  
The most succinct definition I've heard is "It's how we do things around here".  

How can you change culture?  
__Model the behavior you want to see.__

Is that new guy struggling to understand your DevOps pipelines?  
Take some time to show him the ropes, schedule some extra meetings to get him up to speed.

Did your teammate just accomplish something really cool?  
Give her some enthusiastic praise and encouragement!

Is someone struggling with a problem or too much work?  
Offer to help, then lend a helping hand.

You will be surprised at how quickly encouragement and sharing become the new normal.

## Pay it forward

One of our teammates mentors students at the local university and she invited me to help. The seniors in computer science are assigned a software project to help a local non-profit. The software they develop provides a real boost to the over-burdened non-profits.  

This a win-win! The non-profits get some much needed help and the senior students get some great experience. What an opportunity we have to influence the next generation of software developers and change our city's culture.

We invited another team member, an alumni, to mentor this year and he's also found it fulfilling. It was a great feeling when one of our students told us that he looks forward to being able to mentor in a few years!

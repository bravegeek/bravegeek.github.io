# Technology I get to play with

If you read this far, you're probably curious about my technical experience.
I'm primarily a .Net developer with a focus on Azure and CI/CD pipelines.  

A few years ago we moved all new development to Azure. I created the ARM templates to automatically stand-up our resources when deployed to multiple environments using our CI/CD pipeline. Speaking of pipelines, we're using Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services) for all of our builds and releases.
We have multiple lower environments that we can easily promote code through until we end up in production.

I'm the champion for unit tests in our shop, they give me a great feeling of security.  
We actually run our unit tests in our CI/CD pipeline during the build. After leap day (Feb 29th), we had a few pipelines stopping because of broken builds. It turns out that we had some wonky age calculations that our unit tests failed after leap day. We knew it was fixed when the unit tests passed.

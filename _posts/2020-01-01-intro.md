## Experienced, passionate software developer
## Follows and teaches best-practices
## Focused and results driven

---
For the past 25 years I've been a software developer, so being allowed to solve interesting problems with computers has been a blessing.
Recently, I've taken on the role of manager and I've had the privilege of building up my teammates with encouragement, direction, and knowledge sharing.

I'm focused on writing great software using the right tools for the job.
My goal is to guide my team to success, and develop their talents along the way.

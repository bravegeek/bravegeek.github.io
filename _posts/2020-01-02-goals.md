# What keeps me motivated?

I work with a great team, but we have limited resources. If we don't focus on doing things well, our success will also be limited. We want to punch above our weight class, so we agreed on some goals.

* Shorten feedback loops
* Automate everything
* Measure everything	
* Pave our roads with best-practices
* Take ownership

These goals aren't something that can be achieved in a sprint or two, they're more like guiding principles.

### Quick story

Our production releases used to be painful; they required multiple teams to coordinate after hours, took websites offline, and were generally regarded as a chore. If something went wrong, it might be several days before we could attempt another release to production.

I championed getting zero-downtime production releases. I worked closely with our Infrastructure team to get our CI/CD pipelines automatically talking with our on-prem load balancer. Now our releases happen in the middle of the day, multiple times a sprint!

Zero-downtime releases required some automation, but it gets our code to production faster, which shortens our feedback loops. Production releases are now super simple, and there's no more fear. The simplicity make it so any teammate can take ownership and move our code forward.
